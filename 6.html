    <h1><strong><mark>Shahid Afridi</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Shahid Afridi's progress as captain in 2016 culminated in a disappointing and heavily criticized performance at the T20 World Cup, which ultimately led to his resignation from the role. Appointed specifically for this tournament, hopes were initially high, but Pakistan's campaign ended with their first-ever group-stage elimination from a T20 World Cup. The team's performance was subpar, winning only one match against Bangladesh while suffering significant losses to top-tier teams. Compounding the team's struggles was Afridi's own poor individual form with both the bat and the ball, where he failed to lead by example. Off the field, his tenure was marred by controversy, including a widely criticized public comment about receiving more love in India than Pakistan, which further angered fans and officials back home. The team manager's report post-tournament described his leadership as "absolutely clueless," a sentiment echoed by much of the public and media. Following this string of poor results and intense scrutiny, Afridi resigned from the captaincy in April 2016, paving the way for Sarfaraz Ahmed to take over and marking a low point in his leadership career.
