    <p><i>Shahid Afridi's progress as Pakistan's captain in 2010 was marked by a blend of personal success, a notable team performance in the T20 World Cup, and significant disciplinary issues that plagued the team throughout the year. 
Afridi was appointed as the captain for T20Is and ODIs early in 2010. He led Pakistan to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, where they lost a close match to Australia. Personally, he was the tournament's leading wicket-taker, showcasing his individual brilliance as an all-rounder. However, his disciplinary record took a hit when he was caught on camera biting the ball during an ODI in Australia and subsequently banned for two T20Is. 
Later in the year, he was briefly named Test captain for a series in England, but he retired from Test cricket immediately after the first match following a heavy defeat, stating he was not suited for the format. This leadership vacuum led to Salman Butt's captaincy and the subsequent spot-fixing scandal that rocked world cricket, involving Butt, Mohammad Asif, and Mohammad Amir. 
Overall, Afridi provided some on-field performance highlights and led the T20 team reasonably well, but the year was overshadowed by constant instability in captaincy and major controversies. He remained the ODI captain and successfully led the team to the semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup the following year.
