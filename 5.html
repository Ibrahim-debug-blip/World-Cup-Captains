    <h1><strong><mark>Muhammad Hafeez</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Mohammad Hafeez's progress as captain in 2014 culminated in his resignation after a disappointing T20 World Cup performance. Having previously led Pakistan to the semi-finals in 2012, expectations were high for the tournament in Bangladesh. However, Pakistan suffered their first-ever group-stage exit in the history of the T20 World Cup, a failure for which Hafeez took sole responsibility. 
The year was particularly tough for Hafeez's personal form, especially with the bat during the World Cup, where he struggled to score runs consistently, managing only 55 runs in 4 matches at a low average of 13.75. His batting struggles were a concern leading into the tournament, and his inability to lead from the front with performance was a significant factor in the team's overall failure. Following a heavy defeat to the West Indies in a must-win match, Hafeez apologized to the nation and stepped down as T20 captain in April 2014, also relinquishing his ODI vice-captaincy. This resignation was a rare act of accountability in Pakistan cricket and made way for the re-appointment of Shahid Afridi as the T20 captain.
