    <p><i>Younis Khan's progress as Pakistan's captain in 2009 was a mix of a spectacular high point with a major title win, personal batting success, and persistent internal team conflicts that ultimately led to his temporary resignation and the end of his all-format captaincy role. 
He was appointed full-time captain in January 2009 and immediately led by example, scoring a brilliant triple-century (313 runs) in his first Test match in charge against Sri Lanka in Karachi in February. The absolute highlight of his tenure came in June, when he captained Pakistan to their first-ever ICC World Twenty20 title, defeating Sri Lanka in the final at Lord's. This victory provided a crucial morale boost for the nation following the tragic attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in March that year, which halted international cricket in Pakistan for years. 
Despite the T20 success and good form, internal strife and a lack of support from some senior players plagued his leadership throughout the year. The situation culminated in a parliamentary investigation after the team's semi-final loss to New Zealand in the Champions Trophy in October, where allegations of match-fixing and deliberately underperforming were raised. Disgusted by the accusations and feeling he had lost "command" over the team, Younis Khan resigned as captain on October 13, 2009. Although the PCB initially rejected his resignation and a wave of public support encouraged him to stay, he took a break from the game, and Mohammad Yousuf was subsequently named captain for the tour to Australia at the end of the year.
