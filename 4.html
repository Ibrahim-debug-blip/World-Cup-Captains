    <h1><strong><mark>Muhammad Hafeez</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Mohammad Hafeez's progress as Pakistan's T20I captain in 2012 was characterized by strong on-field results and a solid semi-final appearance in the T20 World Cup, though his tenure was not without internal team challenges. Appointed in May 2012, Hafeez adopted a proactive approach, emphasizing team fitness and performance which led to a notable rise in the ICC T20I rankings. The peak of his year was the 2012 T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, where he successfully guided Pakistan through the group stages and into the semi-finals before they were defeated by the host nation. He led by example in that semi-final match, top-scoring for the team and contributing with the ball. Furthermore, his leadership saw Pakistan secure significant bilateral series victories against formidable teams like Australia and South Africa.
However, Hafeez's captaincy style was also a point of contention. His strong stance on fitness and form led to clashes with senior players, most publicly with veteran all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, who expressed disappointment over his non-selection during the World Cup. Reports to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later highlighted a perception of Hafeez as being "unilateral" in his selection approach, with poor communication regarded as a notable flaw. While team results were generally positive under his watch and coach Dav Whatmore supported his merit-based selections, these underlying communication issues created friction within the squad, which would continue to be a talking point throughout his captaincy tenure that lasted until 2014.</i></p>
