    <p><i>In 2024, Babar Azam's second stint as Pakistan's white-ball captain was a turbulent period that ultimately culminated in a disappointing T20 World Cup performance and his subsequent resignation. He was reappointed as the ODI and T20I skipper on March 31, 2024, following the removal of Shaheen Shah Afridi from the T20I captaincy. The decision was part of a strategic move by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to overhaul the leadership ahead of the T20 World Cup. 
The progress under his renewed leadership included T20I series against New Zealand, Ireland, and England as preparation. However, the team's defining challenge was the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and West Indies, where Pakistan failed to advance beyond the group stage. The campaign included a stunning loss to co-hosts USA in a Super Over and another defeat to arch-rivals India, which effectively sealed their fate. The team's poor performance and the persistent scrutiny over his leadership added significant pressure to his role. 
Following the early World Cup exit, Babar Azam announced his decision to step down as white-ball captain for the second time on October 2, 2024, citing a desire to lessen his workload and concentrate fully on his batting to make a bigger impact as a player. The PCB accepted his resignation, and Mohammad Rizwan was eventually appointed as the new white-ball captain later that month. Despite the team's struggles, Babar enjoyed a productive individual year with the bat in T20Is, scoring 738 runs in 24 matches at an average of 33.54, which earned him a nomination for the ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Year award for 2024.
