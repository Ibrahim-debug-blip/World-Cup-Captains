    <h1><strong><mark>Shoaib Malik</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Shoaib Malik's progress as captain in 2007 was a tumultuous yet ultimately successful period on the field, marked by the significant achievement of reaching the final of the inaugural T20 World Cup. Appointed at just 25 years old following the disastrous 2007 ODI World Cup and the retirement of Inzamam-ul-Haq, Malik was seen as a young leader for a fresh start in Pakistan cricket. Backed by coach Bob Woolmer's earlier endorsement, he quickly secured an ODI series win against Sri Lanka and later a home series win against arch-rivals India. Personally, Malik flourished as a batsman under the added responsibility, preferring to bat at number five and maintaining a healthy average while also contributing as a useful off-spinner. 
However, his tenure was also a period filled with internal team politics and controversy. Senior players, including Mohammad Yousuf, Younis Khan, and Shahid Afridi, reportedly felt one of them should have been captain and often clashed with Malik. Post-tenure reports from the coach and team manager criticized his leadership style, describing him as a "loner" who was "aloof" and involved in his own world, leading to a perceived lack of communication with his peers. Despite his reasonable on-field success and good win records in the limited-overs formats (24 wins in 36 ODIs, 12 wins in 17 T20Is in his overall captaincy span), these off-field issues persisted throughout his two-year captaincy, eventually leading to his replacement in early 2009.
